# Configuration

The configuration options will be listed on the charm store, however If you're making assumptions or opinionated decisions in the charm (like setting a default administrator password), you should detail that here so the user knows how to change it immediately, etc.

- Upstream bug tracker
- Upstream mailing list or contact information

## Charm Contact

Though the charm store lists a maintainer, a URL, and where to report bugs you might want to use this area to expand on different contact information if you want.
